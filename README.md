## CT Data Notes

I come across a lot of data stuff, and not all of it makes the news. I've
been planning to start some kind of a mini-blog or email newsletter --
something like [Data is Plural](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural) for
CT -- to catch this stuff, but I haven't had time yet. A GitHub repo seems
simpler, which means I'm more likely to keep up with it. Please feel free
to pull-request additions.

And now, without further ado...

### Week of April 9, 2018

* __Home sales down__ - The Warren Group: [Conn. Single-Family Home Price
  Rises 7.2 Percent in
  February](https://www.thewarrengroup.com/press-room/press-releases/) -
  The Warren Group produces housing market reports on Connecticut and
  Massachusetts. If I were doing a story on this, I'd look at other
  indicators, too. [The Federal Housing Finance
  Agency](https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/pages/house-price-index.aspx)
  also compiles big data sets called house price indexes,
  which can be confusing unless real estate data is your main beat. I
  reported on it [last June](https://ctmirror.org/2017/06/16/latest-house-price-index-connecticut-growth-continues-to-lag/),
  following a quarterly report, and explained a bit about how the price
  indexes work. It looks like the next quarterly report comes out in May.
